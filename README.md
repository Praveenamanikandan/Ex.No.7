## Aim:

To develop a prompt-based application tailored to personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

## Objective:

To explore how natural language prompts can be used to generate useful and personalized outputs.

To demonstrate the development of simple-to-advanced prompt designs for specific use cases.

To encourage creativity and analytical thinking by customizing prompts for different needs.

## Tools & Technologies:

ChatGPT / OpenAI API

Python (optional for automation)

Web Interface (optional frontend for input prompts)

## Concept Overview:

Prompt-based applications use natural language prompts as input instead of traditional programming commands.
By refining the prompt, users can guide the model (ChatGPT) to produce more accurate and meaningful results.

This project focuses on designing prompts for real-world personal applications, such as:

Study Time Scheduler

Project Task Breakdown

Personal Budget Manager

Travel Itinerary Planner

Each application starts with a simple prompt and evolves into an advanced one to show the model’s ability to handle context and detail.

## Algorithm / Steps:

Step 1: Identify the personal problem to solve (e.g., scheduling, budgeting, or planning).

Step 2: Frame a simple prompt describing the task.

Step 3: Generate output using ChatGPT and analyze it.

Step 4: Refine the prompt by adding conditions, constraints, or desired format.

Step 5: Compare outputs from different prompt levels.

Step 6: Store or display the final optimized output to the user.

Example 1 – Study Time Scheduler

## Simple Prompt:

“Make a study timetable for me.”

## Output:

Morning: Math

Afternoon: Science

Evening: English

Advanced Prompt:

“Create a weekly study timetable for a CSE student preparing for exams in Java, Data Structures, and Operating Systems. Include breaks, revision time, and a motivational quote for each day.”

## Output (Structured):

Day	Subjects	Duration	Motivation
Monday	Java, DS	4 hrs	“Start strong!”
Tuesday	OS, Java	4 hrs	“Keep learning!”
...	...	...	...
Example 2 – Project Task Breakdown

## Simple Prompt:

“Break down my project into parts.”

## Advanced Prompt:

“Break down my project ‘Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition’ into detailed tasks and subtasks with weekly goals and dependencies.”

## Output:

Phase	Tasks	Duration
Week 1	Dataset creation, model training	5 days
Week 2	Face recognition integration	5 days
Week 3	Testing and UI design	5 days
Week 4	Deployment and documentation	5 days
Example 3 – Personal Budget Manager

Simple Prompt:

“Help me plan my expenses.”

## Advanced Prompt:

“Create a monthly budget for a college student with ₹12,000 income, allocating funds for rent, food, transport, savings, and entertainment. Show in table format.”

## Output:

Category	Amount (₹)	Percentage
Rent	3,500	30%
Food	2,500	20%
Transport	1,000	10%
Savings	3,000	25%
Entertainment	2,000	15%
Example 4 – Travel Itinerary Planner

Simple Prompt:

“Plan a trip to Kerala.”

Advanced Prompt:

“Plan a 5-day budget trip to Kerala for two people, including travel, accommodation, sightseeing, and food recommendations.”

Output:

Day	Activity	Location	Notes
Day 1	Arrival, Check-in	Kochi	Try local cuisine
Day 2	Backwater Tour	Alleppey	Boat ride
Day 3	Munnar Sightseeing	Munnar	Tea plantations
Day 4	Wildlife Safari	Thekkady	Periyar Tiger Reserve
Day 5	Shopping & Return	Kochi	Local spices & handicrafts
Budget: ₹25,000 (Approx.)			
Advantages:

Reduces manual planning effort

Personalized to individual preferences

Encourages creativity through prompt refinement

Demonstrates the power of LLMs in daily problem-solving

## Applications:

Personal task management

Academic planning tools

Budgeting and financial planning apps

Travel and lifestyle assistance tools

## Result:

A prompt-based application was successfully developed and demonstrated.
The system showed that effective prompt design can generate accurate, structured, and personalized results, enhancing both creativity and problem-solving skills.
